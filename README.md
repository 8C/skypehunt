# 🔎 skypehunt
I've made this neat OSINT tool to allow anyone to easily find information from a skype user, with just a username, phone number or email.

A lot of people seem to think that no one uses skype, but you'll be surprised to see how many people actually use it!

## What can I find?
- Skype ID
- Display Name
- Profile Picture
- Location
- Date of Birth
- Gender
- Email Address
- Creation Date
- Microsoft Teams
